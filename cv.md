## Summary:
My goal is to become a highly skilled full-stack developer. and I am willing to learn and work hard to achieve my goal. I like to understand complex things, it's easy for me to get into a state of flow when I'm doing an interesting activity whether it's programming or yoga. Before that, I was learning backend development in C#, particularly asp.net core. Now I am interested in learning the frontend part.

public ReverseWords(string str)
        { 
            List<string> newStr = str.Split().ToList();
            string str1 = "";


            for (int i = 0; i < newStr.Count; i++)
            {
                char[] charArray = newStr[i].ToCharArray();
                Array.Reverse(charArray);
                str1 += new string(charArray) + " ";
